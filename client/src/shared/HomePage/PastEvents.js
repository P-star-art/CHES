                        <p className="pastevent-text">This initiative was started in October 2019 to help students develop a
                            research-orientated mind. Participating students were assigned problem
                            statements like Self-healing Corrosion-resistant coatings, Innovation in electric
                            batteries, Plastic to Fuel, Nanomaterials, Vector Entrapment, Electrostatic
                            precipitators etc. which needed to be optimised. The program lasted for a month
                            and was successful up to a great extent as students learnt to access, read and
                            analyse the research papers that helped them get an idea of the research field.
                            Groups of 2â€‹nd and 3â€‹rd year students were made to organise the program. Weekly
                            meetings were conducted to discuss the problem statements. There was an online
                            portal assessment to evaluate the progress of each team. Teams presented their
                            research abstracts to the audience in the Blackboard Sessions conducted. Finally,
                            the teams compiled and concluded their optimal solution to the respective problem
                            statement selected by them in the Poster Presentation.</p>
